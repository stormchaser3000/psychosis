These are just random thoughts I have on the subject of enemies assisted by the bosses.
If anyone has a question, concern, or suggestion on enemies then please contact me!


Claustrophobia:
Most likely going to make shadows because what else goes well with that phobia? :/
Most likely will do melee damage!

Bipolar:
Magma Soldiers: They should have melee (hand to hand combat) attack
Ice Witches: Launches an ice spike up to 2 spaces ahead

Anorexia:
She's just going to be the puzzle portion of the game, so she's fine by herself.

Bulimia: 
Launches different foods from his mouth!
There should be different foods after you hurt him enough!
I think Bulimia should throw up just chicken. Some will use a leg as a melee weapon and some will shoot out eggs.
Last stage: There should be a cake-like area the player needs to venture through. 
Then enemies can be frosting zombies (they should be many different pretty colors :3)

Schizophrenia:
Dolls with needle weapons (Melee)
Also all previous enemies!

Megalomania:
Just himself
